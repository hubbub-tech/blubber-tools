Hi {NAME},

<p>
We really appreciate that you signed up with Hubbub! We’re a small team (less
than 5 of us!) with big aspirations, and as one of our early users, you’ve been
a really important part of that journey.
</p>

<p>
We’ve been making a lot of improvements to the experience recently and we’d love
to hear about what’s been working for you and what isn’t over a quick informal
convo. It would be a ~15 minute video call since we don’t want to take up too
much of your time! Do you think you can spare it?
</p>

<p>
If so, just give us a few time-windows that work best for you. Feel free to text
us at (929) 244-0748 if that’s easiest! Otherwise, you can just reply to this email.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for everything, and we’re looking forward to it!
</p>

<p>
Best,
</p>
<p>
Ade from Hubbub
