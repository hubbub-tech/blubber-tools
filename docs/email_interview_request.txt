Hi {NAME},

We really appreciate that you signed up with Hubbub! We’re a small team
(less than 5 of us!) with big aspirations, and as one of our first hundred
users, you’ve been a really important part of that journey :)

We’ve been making a lot of improvements to the experience recently and we want to
hear about what’s been working for you and what isn’t. ver a quick informal
convo. It’ll be a ~15 minute call with one of our founders :). We don’t
want to take up too much of your time! We'd love to meet you and hear more
about what we could be doing to best help you. Do you think you can spare it?

If so, just give us a few time-windows that work best for you. Feel free
to text us at (929) 244-0748 if that’s easiest! Otherwise, you can just
reply to this email.

Thanks for everything, and we’re looking forward to it!

Best,
Hubbub Team
